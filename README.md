well as being accessible via the command-line interface.

You can check all available models using:

### Caching Models

You can pre-load models to avoid downloading them during runtime by using the
`cache` command. To `cache` specific models, such as `xgboost` and `sbert`, run:

```console
asreview nemo cache nb xgboost sbert
```

To cache all available models at once, use:

```console
asreview nemo cache-all
```
